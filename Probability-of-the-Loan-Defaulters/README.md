### Project Overview

 For this project, we will be exploring the publicly available data from LendingClub.com. Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). As an investor one would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying the amount back.

**Problem Statement**

What is the probability that the borrower paid back their loan in full?


### Learnings from the project

 **Outcomes**

The main objective of this task is to provide you with an open field where you can practice and work your way with a dataset end to end without any restrictions from our side. So feel free to play around the model until you arrive at your best solution.

In this project, you will apply the following concepts:

-     Independency check
-     Bayes theorem
-     Visualizing discrete variable
-     Visualizing continuous variable

After completing this project, you will have a better understanding of probability.

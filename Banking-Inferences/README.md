### Learnings from the project

 **Outcomes**

The main objective of this task is to provide you with an open field where you can practise and work your way with a dataset end to end without any restrictions from our side. So feel free to play around the model until you arrive at your best solution.

In this project, you will apply the following concepts:

-     Confidence Interval
-     Central Limit Theorem
-     Hypothesis Testing
-     Chi-Square Test

After completing this project, you will have a better understanding of how to use inferential statistics.

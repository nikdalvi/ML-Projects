### Project Overview

 **Superhero Statistics**

The rise of superheroes and supervillains is at an all-time high. The 'Academy of Super Beings(ASB)' was formed to bring order to it. We have with us the data of more than 500 superhumans but we need your knowledge of descriptive statistics in figuring out the important insights from it. 


### Learnings from the project

 **Outcomes**

The main objective of this task is to provide you with an open field where you can practice and work your way with a dataset end to end without any restrictions from our side. So feel free to play around the model until you arrive at your best solution.

In this project, you will be applying the following concepts:

-    Bar plotting
-     Boxplot plotting
-     Pie-chart plotting
-     Subplot operations
-     Feature Correlation
-     IQR operations

After completing this project, you will have a better grip on the applications of descriptive statistics.

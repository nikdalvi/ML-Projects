### Project Overview

 **Problem statement**

You are a die hard Lego enthusiast wishing to collect as many board sets as you can. But before that you wish to be able to predict the price of a new lego product before its price is revealed so that you can budget it from your revenue. Since (luckily!), you are a data scientist in the making, you wished to solve this problem yourself. This dataset contains information on lego sets scraped from lego.com. Each observation is a different lego set with various features like how many pieces in the set, rating for the set, number of reviews per set etc. Your aim is to build a linear regression model to predict the price of a set.


### Learnings from the project

 **Your aim is to build a linear regression model to predict the price of a set.

About the dataset**

A zipped file containing the following items is given:

    train.csv : The data file train.csv contains the 8582 instances with the 11 features including the target feature.

    test.csv" : The datafile test.csv contains the 3679instances with the 10 features excluding the target feature.

    sample_submission.csv : Explained under the Submission sub-heading

    LCDataDictionary.csv: The file contains data dictionary(Dictionary explaining what each feature of the dataset means) of the LEGO dataset

    LEGO_Dilemma_student_template.ipynb : A template notebook explaining the task breakdown to solve the given problem statement (Learners are recommended to use it)



### Approach taken to solve the problem

 **Outcomes**

The main objective of this task is to provide you with an open field where you can practice and work your way with a dataset end to end without any restrictions from our side. So feel free to play around the model until you arrive at your best solution. In this project, you will apply the following concepts:

-     Train-test split
-     Correlation between the features
-     Linear Regression
-     MSE andR2R^2R2Evaluation Metrics

    After completing this project, you will have the better understanding of how to build a linear regression model.
